Medical Prescription Processing using OpenCV
This repository contains code and resources for processing medical prescriptions using OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. The project aims to automate and enhance the processing of medical prescriptions to improve efficiency and accuracy in healthcare settings.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Includes functions for image enhancement, noise reduction, and resizing to prepare prescription images for analysis.
Text Extraction: Utilizes OpenCV's text detection and recognition capabilities to extract text from prescription images.
Data Validation: Implements algorithms to validate extracted prescription data such as patient information, medication details, and dosage instructions.
Database Integration: Connects with databases to store processed prescription data securely.
User Interface: Optional implementation of a user interface for interacting with the prescription processing system.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/medical-prescription-processing.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
Capture or upload a medical prescription image using the provided interface.
The system will preprocess the image, extract relevant text, and validate the prescription details.
Processed data will be stored in the connected database for further analysis or use.
